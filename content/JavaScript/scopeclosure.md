# Notes Taken From https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

# Hoisting

- Declarations are processed first by the compiler.
- Function expressions are not hoisted.
- Hoisting order: first functions and then variables.
- Subsequent var definitions ignored. Subsequent function definitions accepted and replace original.
