# Advantages to Using React

1. Easier to manage UI state.
2. Focus on business logic instead of rules for targeting elements.

# Single page vs multi-page

1. Single Page:
   - content is rendered on the client side.
   - one reactDOM.render() call
2. Multi-Page:
   - content is rendered on server.
   - one reactDOM.render() call per widget
